# Human-Action-Recoginition
Computer Vision
In this project we classify human actions based on the image.
There are 15 different classes - sitting, using_laptop, hugging, sleeping, drinking,
clapping, dancing, cycling, calling, laughing, eating, fighting, listening_to_music, running, texting.
We use CNN to classify the images.
